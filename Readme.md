## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 (or whichever version you're using)
- pip
- virtualenv (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FarehaSi/global-gazette-backend.git backend
   cd backend/
   ```
2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv 
    
    ```
    ## Activating the Virtual Environment

        To activate the virtual environment, follow the instructions below based on your operating system:

        ### Windows

        ```
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

        ### Mac and Linux

        ```
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

        Once you have activated the virtual environment, you should see the name of the environment in your command prompt or terminal. This indicates that you are now working within the virtual environment and can install packages and run your application without affecting your system's global Python installation.
